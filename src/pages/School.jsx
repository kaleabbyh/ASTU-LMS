            The current School of Electrical Engineering and Computing is
            established following, the renaming of the Adama Science and
            Technology University by the Council of Ministers in May 2011 and
            shifting of the university from Ministry of Education (MoE) to
            Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) to work towards the
            attainment to become the best Centre of Excellencies in Science and
            Technology in Ethiopia. Thereby, allowing for the realization of
            goal has set in the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP).

                  The mission of the Computer Science and Engineering CSE
                  program is to provide students with a broad and flexible
                  education in computer science and engineering, to prepare its
                  graduates for rapidly changing technological fields, and give
                  them a sound basis for professional practice, advanced
                  education, active citizenship, and lifelong learning. The
                  students are prepared to expand this knowledge through
                  research into new technologies, design methods, and analysis
                  techniques that link the knowledge with multi-disciplinary
                  fields and advance the state of the art. With a knowledge of
                  contemporary technological issues and their impact globally,
                  economically, and environmentally, computer scientists and
                  engineers are at the forefront of advances that continually
                  transform society. <Link href="https://www.astu.edu.et/images/linked-pdf/SoEEC-Website-Profile-sent-for-PR.pdf"> learn more</Link>
